*Graphical abstract: Traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and vanilla LLMs suffer from Popularity Bias, disproportionately favoring high-degree nodes (e.g., Semagacestat) regardless of clinical efficacy, while overlooking sparse "cold-start" candidates (e.g., Thalidomide). Our framework incorporates a Clinical Arbiter mechanism via KTO Optimization. The model generates CoT for both candidates. Phase III clinical trial outcomes serve as ground-truth rewards: popular but failed drugs receive a penalty, while valid “cold” candidate receive a positive reinforcement. This feedback loop aligns the LLM's latent space with clinical reality, enabling it to reject scientific hype and identify hidden therapeutic gems.*
